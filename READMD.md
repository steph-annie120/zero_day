# Zero-Day Project

This project is a part of my Alx software engineering program. Its purpose is for me to learn how to push my first file in my first repository as a task in my first school project.

## Getting Started

1. Create a file named README.md using a command line editor like Emacs or Vi
2. Write a small Markdown text to present the project.
3. Add the README.md file to Git using the command `git add README.md`.
4. Commit the changes with the message "My first commit" using the command `git commit -m "My first commit"`.
5. Push the changes to the remote server using the command `git push origin master`. (Note: I may need to
enter my GitHub username and password).

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the Zero-Day Project, you can follow the steps outlined in the "Getting Started" section to add your own files to the repository and push changes to the remote server.
